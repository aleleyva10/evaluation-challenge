Overview

In this challenge you will show us what you know about creating a Server, Database, and Front-End using AngularJS.

You will be creating an application that pulls a name and location list of three businesses. Your tasks will include building the application from the ground up, while also populating a database with data supplied below.

Requirements

Build a Node/Express server that includes a route to retrieve the data from the database.
The data should be located in an SQL database. The data provided should emulate the below data:
Name	Phone Number
Pizza Hut	651-488-8888
Papa Johns	612-374-5622
Pizza Luce	612-333-7359
Once the AngularJS application loads, Angular should make a call to the server to retrieve the data. That data should be stored inside of a controller.
Using ngRepeat, the data should then be displayed on the DOM in whatever fashion you like.
Optional

Clicking on one of the list items from the ngRepeat should display text somewhere on the DOM with that item's phone number.
